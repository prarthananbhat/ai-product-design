## Introduction to the Artificial Intelligence Design Process

The four stages of the AI Product Design are below

**Stage I : 
Identify a behaviour that AI can do - *Intelligence***

To identify a behavior that an AI system could enact, first determine a broad taxonomy with what is possible. Next, come up with examples. To come up with examples, consider the following questions:
What can humans do? (e.g., a yoga trainer can correct your posture)
What are some similar AI examples? (e.g., Posenet gives us a total of 17 key points which we can use, right from our eye to and ears to knees and ankles. This can be used to identify the posture)

**Stage II : 
Define a Business process that incorporates this behaviour - *Business Process***

Now that you have a behavior, you need to define a business process that incorporates this behavior. Defining a business process includes 90% of your value.

In this stage, you begin to develop the AI approach. In developing an AI approach, you need:
1.    A set of data
2.    An architecture
3.    An objective

**Stage III : 
Develop an AI Approach - *AI Technology***

These technologies combine to create an architecture to accomplish the AIâ€™s objective of implementation. 
However, for this implementation to occur, the AI must undergo training. There are three types of AI training:
1.    Supervised learning
2.    Unsupervised learning
3.    Reinforcement learning
In our example
We can use Pose net is a supervised model 

**Stage IV : 
Create it - *Tinkering***
The final stage is tinkering. Tinkering comprises 90% of your time. This is where most AI engineers do their work. Tinkering denotes the day-to-day actions of working with AI technologies. Stage 4 completes the development cycle.

Details about every stage
**Stage 1: Intelligence**
1. **Performance Metrics** : How you want to evaluate your product, In our case, 
 * detecting the pose accurately - mainly the POse estimation model should be accuarate
 * The AI Yoga trainer should be able to compare the pose with the ideal/ best pose and make accurate comments
 * The time lag of comments should be very minimal to get a trainer feeling
 * Many more might come along the way of design


2. **Scope** : 
 Scope of the behaviour
 the yoga trainer is dedicated for only one person
