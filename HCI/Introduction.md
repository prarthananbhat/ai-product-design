#### Human—Computer Interaction
Human-computer interaction or short HCI focuses on the interaction between humans and computers. HCI is not only about interaction with traditional computers, but also with all sorts of other technology, for example, augmented reality, variable devices and 3D printing technology.

What is HCI?
More specifically, human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study that looks at computer technology design and human-computer interaction, covering all forms of information technology design.

HCI is a field based on computer technology and design, where researchers try to look at the way humans interact with computers in order to design technologies that allow them to interact in a more human and novel way.

Today, this field lies between computer science, behavioural science, design and media studies. The term tries to convey that computers and computational devices have many uses and always involve an open dialogue between user and computer, which is to be compared to the interaction between humans, a very important analogy for theoretical and future considerations in this science.

Areas of HCI
1. Building new devices and Hardware: So, 
whenever users interact with a piece of hardware, such as a new smart phone or augmented reality headset, somebody had  to develop the piece of hardware first.
2. Interaction techniques and modalities: So, once the hardware is there, HCI developers still have to define how a user should interact with the device. How should the user be able to provide input to the device, and how should the device respond? 
3. Specific application areas: The third area of HCI research is the development of applications for specific use cases and areas. So, HCI developers have to create applications for these specific use cases and user groups.
